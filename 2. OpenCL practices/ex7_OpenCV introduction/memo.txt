Note:
- This source code illustrates implementation of simple and well-known image masks(kernels) using OpenCV which can be found in wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing). 
- Names of masks implemented and their matrices are as follows:
[1] Sharpen      [2] Edge detection      [3] Gaussian Blur
   0 -1  0             -1  -1  -1             1/16 2/16 1/16
  -1  5 -1             -1   8  -1             2/16 4/16 2/16
   0 -1  0             -1  -1  -1             1/16 2/16 1/16
- Developed with OS X and Xcode.
- Configurations are also uploaded as xcodeproj file format.
